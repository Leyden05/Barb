        <h2 class="text-lg max-w-[1170px] px-32 font-light">Music has always been a comforting force for Barb, but after putting her D-I athletic career and 3x NCAA top-finisher identity to rest, writing became her vessel for self-expression. Treating her ambitious music career like her athletic one, the former Texas Longhorn and Austin local spends hours a day producing music and practicing guitar.</h2><h2 class="text-lg px-32 max-w-[1170px] py-6 font-light">She balances her boldness with a sensitive and light-hearted perspective, exploring the complexities of friendship, love, and growing up in her subtly queer lens. Described most often as "feel-good indie rock," her music effortlessly finds its place on playlists alongside artists like The Beaches, COIN, Tash Sultana, Spacey Jane, and Dayglow. And while she occasionally explores the weight of heartbreak, self-reflection, and mental health, her music most frequently serves as a sunny day at the pool or a road trip with your best friends.</h2>
